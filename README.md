# javacource

This repository contains Java code, likely from a learning or practice environment. It appears to cover various fundamental Java concepts and algorithms.

## Key Features & Benefits

*   **Fundamentals Coverage:** Explores core Java programming principles.
*   **Algorithm Implementations:** Provides practical examples of common algorithms like searching and sorting.
*   **Educational Resource:**  Potentially a valuable resource for Java learners.
*   **Modular Structure:** Organizes code into distinct directories for different topics.

## Prerequisites & Dependencies

*   **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Required to compile and run Java code.  Version 8 or higher is recommended.  Download from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) or [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/).
*   **Integrated Development Environment (IDE) (Optional):**  Recommended for code editing and debugging.  Popular choices include:
    *   IntelliJ IDEA (Community Edition is free)
    *   Eclipse
    *   Visual Studio Code with Java extensions

## Installation & Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/GOD-DEBANG/javacource.git
    cd javacource
    ```

2.  **Import into IDE (Optional):**

    *   **IntelliJ IDEA:** Open the `javacource` directory as a project.  IntelliJ IDEA should automatically detect the Java source files.
    *   **Eclipse:** Create a new Java project and import the source files from the `src` and other module directories.
    *   **Visual Studio Code:** Install the Java Extension Pack. Open the `javacource` directory. VS Code will prompt you to configure the Java environment.

3.  **Compile and Run:**

    *   **Using an IDE:**  The IDE should provide options to compile and run the `Main.java` files within each directory.
    *   **Using the Command Line:**
        1.  Navigate to the directory containing the `Main.java` file you want to run (e.g., `array/src`).
        2.  Compile the Java file: `javac Main.java`
        3.  Run the compiled class: `java Main`

## Usage Examples & API Documentation

Each directory (`array`, `bineary search`, etc.) contains a `src` directory with Java files demonstrating a specific concept.

**Example: Running the `array` module's `Main.java`**

```bash
cd array/src
javac Main.java
java Main
```

The specific functionality of each Java file can be inferred from the code itself.  Due to the lack of detailed documentation within the code, it is recommended to carefully examine the source code to understand its purpose and usage.

## Configuration Options

This project doesn't appear to have any configurable settings or environment variables.  The behavior of the code is determined by the hardcoded values within the Java files.

## Contributing Guidelines

Contributions are welcome! To contribute:

1.  **Fork the Repository:** Create your own fork of the `javacource` repository.
2.  **Create a Branch:** Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
3.  **Make Changes:** Implement your changes and ensure they are well-tested.
4.  **Submit a Pull Request:** Submit a pull request to the `main` branch of the original `javacource` repository.

Please ensure your code adheres to the following guidelines:

*   **Code Style:** Follow standard Java coding conventions.
*   **Comments:** Add clear and concise comments to explain your code.
*   **Testing:** Include unit tests to verify the correctness of your code.
*   **Documentation:** Update the README or add new documentation to reflect your changes.

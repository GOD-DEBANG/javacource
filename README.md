```java
 This repo is not just code.
 It’s a reflection of who I was, who I am, and who I’m becoming.

public class Journey {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        while(true) {
            learn();
            grow();
            commit();
        }
    }
}
"Every line I write is a step forward.
This is not perfection — this is persistence."

📍 Daily logs of learning.
🧠 From basics to brilliance.
